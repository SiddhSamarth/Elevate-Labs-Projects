# üîç Nmap Network Reconnaissance ‚Äì Cyber Security Internship Task 1

---

## Objective

This project involved scanning the local network using **Nmap** to identify active hosts, enumerate open ports, and analyze services to understand network exposure.  
The task emphasises fundamental network reconnaissance and service identification practices essential to cybersecurity assessments.

---

## Skills Learned

- Conducting active network scanning using TCP SYN (`-sS`) technique.
- Analysing local IP ranges and interpreting Nmap scan output.
- Identifying common services based on open ports.
- Assessing security risks based on service exposure.
- Using **Wireshark** to capture and verify scan traffic at packet level.
- Documenting scan results and mapping services to known vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used

- **Nmap** ‚Äì Port scanning and host discovery  
- **Ubuntu (CLI)** ‚Äì Terminal-based scanning environment  
- **Wireshark** *(optional)* ‚Äì Packet capture and deep inspection  
- **Markdown** ‚Äì Reporting and documentation via GitHub

## Steps

**1. Find your IP and local subnet using:**

```bash
ip a
Then, grab the IP address and run a Nmap Scan on your Linux CLI

**sudo nmap -sS 192.XXX.XXX.0/24 -oN scan.txt**
