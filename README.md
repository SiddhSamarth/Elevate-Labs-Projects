## üéØ Objectives & Key Takeaways

Each module hones a distinct facet of cybersecurity practice:

1. **Network Reconnaissance**  
   - Map network topology and identify live hosts.  
   - Enumerate open ports & services; perform version/OS fingerprinting.  
   - Analyze scan results to build an actionable network profile.

2. **Phishing Detection & Analysis**  
   - Extract and dissect email headers for origin and routing anomalies.  
   - Examine embedded URLs and attachments for malicious payloads.  
   - Correlate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and craft mitigation advice.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**  
   - Execute automated scans (OpenVAS, Nessus) to uncover vulnerabilities.  
   - Perform manual validation of critical findings.  
   - Classify risks (CVSS scores), prioritize remediations, and document action plans.

4. **Host Hardening & Firewall Management**  
   - Define and enforce least-privilege network policies with UFW.  
   - Create, test, and validate firewall rules for SSH, Telnet, and other services.  
   - Implement cleanup procedures to restore a secure baseline.
