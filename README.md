# Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Practicals

Welcome! This repository is my curated portfolio of hands-on cybersecurity labs that I completed during the **Elevate Labs** program. Through these exercises, I explored real-world security scenarios, applied systematic methodologies, used industry-standard tools, and documented outcomes with analysis and insights.

## 🚀 What This Repository Is About

I designed this project collection to reflect tangible progress in foundational cybersecurity skills. Each lab focuses on a distinct aspect of security — from network scanning to email forensics to vulnerability assessment and firewall hardening.

By completing these modules, I strengthened my ability to think like both an analyst and a defender, using practical tools and documented workflows to solve problems and interpret findings.
